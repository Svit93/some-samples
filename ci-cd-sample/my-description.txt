A sample of code for task that runs automatically for testing environments to update versions of services (independent apps).

There is configured a time scheduler in Azure pipelines which runs pipeline defined by the .yml file.
The most important part of .yml is that it triggers a gradle task which executes the "test" in kotlin file.
